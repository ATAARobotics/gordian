It is a scripting language written in Java to run programs based solely on their text.\r\nIt is interpreted, and provides no guarantees. A lot of errors are caught at runtime, which might make your job harder. As a bonus however, Gordian is extremely lightweight, flexible and can be hacked very easily.
