{"name":"Gordian","tagline":"Alberta Tech Alliance's Scripting Language","body":"# GORDIAN #\r\n===========\r\nLightweight portable scripting language interpreted and run inside of Java with minimal dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Purpose\r\nGordian is designed specifically for [FRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRST_Robotics_Competition) programming. Fortunately, it is useful for all kinds of different functions.\r\n\r\nGordian is made to be an easy-to-learn scripting language meant for simple programs with normal control flow. \r\n\r\nGordian is well suited for:\r\n\r\n- Function-based scripts\r\n- Complex control flow with input and output\r\n- Interpreter of input (ie. configuration files)\r\n\r\nGordian is modelled with inspiration from Python and Lua.\r\n\r\n## Platform\r\nGordian is designed to run on a minimum of Java ME 1.4 on the squawk VM, using the WPILibJ libraries.\r\n\r\n- Gordian for FRC is available at https://github.com/Team4334/gordian\r\n- Gordian for Java SE (or your choice of supported platform) is available at https://github.com/Team4334/gordianSE\r\n- Gordian as a desktop program is available at https://github.com/Team4334/desktop-gordian\r\n- Gordian as a compilable program is availble at https://github.com/Team4334/gordian-compiler\r\n\r\n## Project Goals\r\nGordian is a project that aims to help innovate quickly without tinkering embedded code. Its goals are simple:\r\n\r\n- Provide easy, safe syntax for any use\r\n- Avoid any feature creep and stay stable\r\n\r\n## Calling from Java\r\nUse `Gordian.run` to run your script in Java. For more access to variables and elements, use `Gordian.getRuntime()`. Many options are there for accessing the runtime environment. \r\n\r\n# Language specification\r\nGordian follows a semi-strict, dynamic syntax that allows the user many options for scripts. Its syntax is designed to avoid as many possible parsing bugs and unpredictable behaviour.\r\n\r\nFull specification is available [here](https://github.com/Team4334/gordian/blob/master/SPEC.md).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
